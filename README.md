I'll write better build instructions. However, for now here is how you get going:
1. Clone into {UE4 Project}/Plugins/ so that the directory looks like this {UE4 Project}/Plugins/LensCalibrator/
2. Delete Binaries, Intermediate, Saved in the root of the UE4 project.
3. Right click {UE4 Project}.uproject and select "Generate Visual Studio project files".
